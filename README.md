# Twitter Clone Exercise

This exercise involves enhancing a partially functional Twitter clone. Students will practice reading and understanding existing code, addressing bugs, writing tests, and adding new features.

## Key Steps:

1. **Clean & Commit As You Go:**

   - Maintain code cleanliness and documentation.
   - Frequent Git commits to track changes.
2. **Setup:**

   - Create a Python virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Set up the database and start the server.
3. **Part One: Fix Current Features:**

   - Understand the data model by reading `models.py`.
   - Fix logout functionality, user profile display, and user cards.
   - Implement profile editing and adjust the homepage to show relevant warbles.
   - Research and understand the login strategy.
4. **Part Two: Add Likes:**

   - Implement a backend feature for users to "like" and "unlike" warbles.
   - Display the number of liked warbles on user profiles.
5. **Part Three: Add Tests:**

   - Write tests for models (e.g., User, Message) and view functions.
   - Test authentication and authorization scenarios.
   - Use `unittest` to run tests.

This exercise encourages students to treat the task like a real-world project, fostering good coding practices and reinforcing understanding of Flask, SQLAlchemy, and testing methodologies.
